 lexemes are only the raw substrings of the source code
 lexeme = group of char that has meaning
 need to recognise how a lexeme looks like ('while' is a lexeme), and which kind of lexeme it represents
 every token got a type, like 'while' can be a token, '2' can be a token of type literal
 use regex to figure out what tokentype it is
 how they group characters into lexeme, ie identifying what character is what tokenType is called **lexical grammar**
 definition of regular language: can be recognised by a finite automaton
 maximal munch: when a chunk of code makes sense under two lexical grammar, whichever matches the most characters win
 exp: 'orchid' can be match under logical 'or' and string 'orchid'
 a reserved word is an identifier
 use java com.craftinginterpreters.lox.Lox to run
 -- until this point, we turned string to a serioes of token, but it is not yet a parser
